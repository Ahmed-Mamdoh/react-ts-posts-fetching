# 📰 Posts Fetching App (React + TypeScript)

## 📘 Description
This project was built while following the [**React & TypeScript – The Practical Guide**](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-typescript-the-practical-guide/).  
It focuses on working with **asynchronous data fetching**, managing **typed HTTP requests**, and displaying data safely using TypeScript.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Fetching and displaying data using `fetch()` with proper TypeScript types  
- Defining interfaces for fetched data (e.g., `Post`)  
- Handling asynchronous operations safely in React + TS  
- Managing loading and error states with strong typing  
- Using React hooks like `useEffect` and `useState` with proper type inference
